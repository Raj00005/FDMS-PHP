# Food Donation Management System (FDMS)

The Food Donation Management System (FDMS) is a platform designed to streamline the process of donating and receiving food. It helps food donors, such as restaurants, hotels, event organizers, and weekend parties, to communicate what they have to give. It also allows charities and shelters to specify what they need. FDMS keeps track of donated food to ensure nothing goes to waste and optimizes the distribution of donations to the right places.

## Features

- **Easy Communication**: Facilitates communication between food donors and recipients.
- **Tracking Donations**: Keeps a record of all donated food to ensure transparency and efficiency.
- **Waste Reduction**: Ensures that no food goes to waste by managing and optimizing the distribution process.
- **Impact Visualization**: Allows all parties involved to see the impact of their contributions.
